m# QuantumVsClassicalComputer
The purpose of this reposiory is to document my understanding of how a Quantum computer differs from a Classical computer.
I will use as a reference "Quantum Mechanics", Leonard Susskind and Art Friedman, Basic Books published 2014 to understand
the basic Math of quantum mechanics.  I will use QISKit as a means to code a Quantum computer.
